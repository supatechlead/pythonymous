Following post will introduce advanced ReactJS props concepts.

## Function as prop


"Function as prop" refers to the practice in React where a function is passed as a prop to a child component. This allows you to pass behavior or functionality from a parent component to a child component, making your React application more flexible and dynamic.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the concept:
> ParentComponent.js
```jsx
import React from 'react';

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    alert('Button clicked!');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Parent Component</h1>
      <ChildComponent handleClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```
> ChildComponent.js
```jsx
// ChildComponent.js
import React from 'react';

const ChildComponent = ({ handleClick }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Child Component</h2>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ChildComponent;
```
In this example:

* The `ParentComponent` defines a function called `handleClick`.
* The `ParentComponent` renders the `ChildComponent` and passes the `handleClick` function as a prop to it.
* The `ChildComponent` receives the `handleClick` function as a prop and uses it to handle the button click.

## React Children Prop


In React, the `children` prop is a special prop that represents the content between the opening and closing tags of a component. It is used to pass components, elements, or text content as children to a React component. The `children` prop allows you to compose complex UI structures by nesting components within each other.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the concept of the children prop:
> ParentComponent.js
```jsx
import React from 'react';

const ParentComponent = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Parent Component</h1>
      <div>{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```
> App.js
```jsx
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import ParentComponent from './ParentComponent';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <ParentComponent>
        <p>This is a child component.</p>
        <button>Click me</button>
      </ParentComponent>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
## Component as Prop


"Component as prop" refers to a pattern in React where a component is passed as a prop to another component. This pattern is often used to provide dynamic behavior or to encapsulate functionality within a component, making it more reusable and flexible.

Here's a basic example to illustrate the concept:

> ParentComponent.js
```jsx
import React from 'react';

const ParentComponent = ({ childComponent }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Parent Component</h1>
      {childComponent}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```
> App.js
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ParentComponent from './ParentComponent';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>App Component</h1>
      {/* Using Component as Prop */}
      <ParentComponent childComponent={<ChildComponent />} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
In this example:

* `ParentComponent` is a component that receives a prop named `childComponent`.
* In `App.js`, an instance of `ChildComponent` is passed as a prop to `ParentComponent`.

## Children as a Function

The "children as a function" pattern in React involves using the `children` prop as a function, allowing a component to pass dynamic content or behavior to its children. Instead of passing components or elements as children, you pass a function, and the children of the component are the result of invoking that function.

Here's a basic example to illustrate the concept:
> ParentComponent.js
```jsx
import React from 'react';

const ParentComponent = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Parent Component</h1>
      {children("Hello from ParentComponent")}
    </div>
  );
};
```
> App.js
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ParentComponent from './ParentComponent';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>App Component</h1>
      {/* Using "children as function" pattern */}
      <ParentComponent>
        {(message) => <p>{message}</p>}
      </ParentComponent>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
In this example:

* ParentComponent takes a `children` prop, which is a function.
* Inside `ParentComponent`, it calls the `children` function with a message.
* In `App`, when using `ParentComponent`, a function is passed as the `children` prop. This function receives the message from `ParentComponent` and returns JSX based on that message.
